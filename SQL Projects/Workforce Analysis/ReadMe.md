## Employee Data Management and Analytics with PL/SQL

### About the Project:
This project uses PL/SQL to manage and analyze employee data in a database. It focuses on solving real-world HR and workforce management problems, 
like tracking employee distribution, analyzing salaries, automating promotion checks, and maintaining a record of all changes to employee data.

The project showcases how PL/SQL can streamline database operations while keeping data organized and actionable.

### What This Project Does:
- Counts Employees by Department and Country: Finds how many employees are in each department and country using PL/SQL loops.
- Analyzes Salaries by Region: Calculates maximum, minimum, and average salaries for different regions using a custom function.
- Tracks Total Salary by Department: Creates a view to show the total salaries for departments where salaries exceed a certain amount.
- Checks Promotion Eligibility: Automates the process of checking if employees qualify for promotions based on their job titles and time with the company.
- Keeps a Record of Employee Changes: A trigger logs every insert, update, or delete action on the employees table into an emp_audit table. This helps track who changed what and when.

### Key Goals:
- Simplify HR and workforce analysis with SQL and PL/SQL tools.
- Automate repetitive tasks like promotion checks.
- Ensure data accuracy and accountability with audit logs.
- Provide actionable insights into employee data, like salary trends and distribution.
  
### Tools Used:
- PL/SQL: For writing procedures, triggers, views, and functions.
- Oracle Database: The database platform for running the project.

### Highlights of the Project:
- Employee Distribution: See how employees are spread across departments and countries.
- Salary Insights: Compare salary ranges and averages by region.
- Promotion Automation: Simplifies the process of identifying employees eligible for promotions.
- Audit Logging: Tracks all changes to employee data for transparency and accountability.
