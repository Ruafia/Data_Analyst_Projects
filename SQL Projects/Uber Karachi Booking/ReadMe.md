## SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Uber Bookings

### Project Overview:
Welcome! This project is all about exploring and analyzing a dataset from Uber's bookings using SQL. By diving into the data, we uncover interesting insights about bookings, cancellations, customer behavior, and performance metrics.

- Customer Habits: Who are the top riders, and how do cancellations vary among customers?
- Cancellation Reasons: Why do rides get canceled, and what are the patterns?
- Revenue Insights: How much value do successful and canceled bookings generate?
- Ratings Analysis: Understanding driver and customer ratings across different vehicle types.

### Tools and Techniques:
- SQL: For all the analysis and insights.
- Views and CTEs: To simplify repetitive or complex queries.
- Aggregations: Calculations like averages, sums, and counts to summarize the data.

### Highlights from the Analysis:
- Top Customers: Found the most frequent riders and how many trips they took.
- Cancellations: Explored the main reasons for cancellations and their frequency.
